## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of variables?<br/>
  Variables act as containers for storing data.<br/>

- How do you **declare** a variable?<br/>
  Using the const, let, or var keywords.<br/>

- How do you initialize (**assign a value to**) a variable?<br/>
  Using the assignment operator.<br/>

- What characters are allowed in variable names?<br/>
  Letters, digits, underscores and dollar signs but must start with a letter, $, or \_.<br/>

- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?<br/>
  Referencing 2 variables using different casings will refer to two different variables. Age is not the same as age for a variable name.<br/>

- What is the purpose of a string?<br/>
  String designates a sequence of characters and are used for that purpose (words, sentences, paragraphs, etc.).<br/>

- What is the purpose of a number?<br/>
  To represent arithmetical value for calculations or quantity for counting, showing order, or identification.<br/>

- What is the purpose of a boolean?<br/>
  To represent a true or false value<br/>

- What does the `=` operator mean in JavaScript?<br/>
  It is the assignment operator and it assigns the value on the right side of the operator to the variable on the left side of the operator.<br/>

- How do you update the value of a variable?<br/>
  By assigning a new value to it.<br/>

- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?<br/>
  `null` represents an empty value and must be assigned explicitly while `undefined` indicates that the variable has not been defined.<br/>

- Why is it a good habit to include "labels" when you log values to the browser console?<br/>
  To help debug our code and to assist in the future when we return to old code for maintenance or enhancements.<br/>

- Give five examples of JavaScript primitives.<br/>

1. boolean<br/>
2. number<br/>
3. string<br/>
4. undefined<br/>
5. null<br/>
