## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?<br/>
  A piece of code that can take inputs and can performs an action then returns to the place in code from which it was called with a returned value or the absence of a returned value.<br/>

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.<br/>
  A name (or anonymous/arrow function), parameter list, and a JS statement (optionally a return value) enclosed in curly braces (a body).<br/>

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.<br/>
  A function name followed by a comma separated argument list.<br/>

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?<br/>
  The difference is that the function **call** does not include the function's body.<br/>

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?<br/>
  A parameter is a placeholder while the argument is the value passed to the function when the function is being called.<br/>

- Why are function **parameters** useful?<br/>
  They facilitate a level of abstraction.<br/>

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?<br/>
  It terminates the current function and returns to the location in code in which the function was called with the return value.<br/>

- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?<br/>
  ()=>{} or Round parentheses`()`, followed by a greater than or equal to sign `=>`, usually followed by curly braces `{}` <br/>

- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?<br/>
  It can only contain a single expression and is implicitly returned.<br/>
